          <p>I was born in the Quezon City, Philippines! I immigrated to Auckland, New Zealand when I was a wee little 3-year-old Bea.</p>

        <div class="grid-item">
          <p>In 2022, I wrote my very-first piece of code in a compulsory university course.
          I quickly discovered that coding way too much fun for me.

          Ironically growing up, I had little to no interest in computers besides playing games (…fine, just Roblox) on them.
          But I always grew up around hardware scattered around the house since my dad works in IT.</p>

        <div class="grid-item">
          <p>I have a much longer history with the arts than I do with sciences.</p>
          <ul>
            <li>I grew up watching cartoons and consider myself a life-long self-taught drawer. Nowadays, I do it mostly for fun nowadays when I feel the urge.</li>
            <li>I learnt Photoshop in high school for **graphic design** and my love for it still goes strong! My Pinterest is full to the brim.</li>
            <li>Halfway through my second year in university, I felt a strong urge to learn 3D modelling. I did a few courses in Blender and still do it every once in a while.
               However sometimes I just cheat and use world-building games...</li>

        <div class="grid-item">
          <p>So, what is Beatriz currently hyperfixated on?</p>
          <p>Ah yes, my famous ever-revolving door of different interests.</p>

          <p>As of this moment, I am currently <span class="extra-bold">obsessed</span> with space, aerospace, astrophysics.
            This may or may-not be related to watching Star Wars and The Expanse.</p>
            
          <ul>
            <li>If the moon, stars, or a plane is visible in the sky, I <span class="extra-bold italic">guarantee</span> you I will marvel at it.</li>
            <li>I’m in the process of researching and saving up for my first telescope!</li>
